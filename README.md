## Motivation

Beyond just contributing to open source projects, the MLH Fellowship offers opportunities to learn new skills and develop new connections. With over 20 channels dedicated to tech topics in the Discord channel and with workshops happening nearly everyday, there's a lot to takeaway from these 12-weeks. And it can also be incredibly overwhelming to manage it all.

That is where Fellowboard comes in. **Fellowboard** is a platform for fellows to continue curating resources while organizing them in a manner that best suits *their* needs. Fellows can create new posts for others to see, pin posts to keep track of whats most meaningful to them, and view all of their pinned posts in one page. MLH Workshops uploaded to Youtube, links shared in the discord channels, and information on other Fellows are already created so that the past 6 weeks aren't lost.
